Basics of threading a process. Creating threads and exploring the use of mutexes




Here are the key things you need to know to succeed in this assignment:

🤓 One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.

🤓 The philosophers take turns eating, thinking, and sleeping.
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

🍴 There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.

🍝 Since eating spaghetti with just one fork is impractical, a philosopher must pick up
both the fork to their right and the fork to their left before eating.

😴 When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.
 
🍔 Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

🙊 Philosophers do not communicate with each other.

🤷‍♀️ Philosophers do not know if another philosopher is about to die.

💀 Needless to say, philosophers should avoid dying!
